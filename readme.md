# 🍳 Kitchen Chaos – Unity Game (Learning Project)

Hi! I'm Kushaal 👋  
This is a Unity project I'm building while following the **Kitchen Chaos** game tutorial by [Code Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg).  
I'm using this as a learning experience to understand Unity, C#, and core game development concepts.
